    <h1>12 Favorite Problems</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly
            present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a
            dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new
            result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether
            it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will
            say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"
        </p>

            What really matters more for a product? Distribution? Or having a
            good product?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The most obvious case that comes to mind is Roy Lee's Cluely, the AI
            cheating tool that went so viral it landed a <a
                href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-cluely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >$15M Series A from a16z</a
            > at a $120M valuation. However, soon after the investment, it became
            almost crystal clear to users that the product could not sustain what
            the distribution initially promised. A series of issues plagued cluely's
            product: latency issues, a data breach, and ultimately an un-winnable
            arms race between interview platforms to ensure hiring integrity.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            These issues ultimately led to Cluely's pivot to enterprise
            software, ditching the original "undetectable cheating" product
            altogether. Allegedly, ARR doubled within a week of the pivot, but
            that's only because the underlying technology found a use-case where
            the product actually mattered.

            What are the remaining barriers to AGI that can't be solved by
            scaling compute and engineering effort?

            If AI drives the marginal cost of implementation to zero, what makes
            one engineer more valuable than another?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The obvious candidates are architectural judgment, product
            intuition, or something like taste — but those feel like they might
            just be the next things to get automated. Maybe the answer is
            something less legible, like knowing which problems are worth
            solving in the first place.
        </dd>

        <dt>What exactly is taste?</dt>

        <dt>Is taste ultimately a data problem?</dt>

        <dt>
            If anyone can build anything, does the concept of a product still
            make sense?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            If the cost of building is near-zero, maybe the unit of value shifts
            from the product to something upstream — taste, curation, knowing
            what to build. Or maybe products just become disposable and
            single-use.
        </dd>

        <dt>
            If engineering becomes near-free, does open source lose its reason
            to exist?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The easiest counter-argument that comes to mind is the lack of
            engineering taste for in-house builders. However, what exactly is
            taste, and is it something that can be solved using more data? This
            ultimately goes back to the taste question above.
